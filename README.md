# First steps

- add `with side_effects` to function `Get_Free_Node`; also requires changing
  two constants to variables as one can't use functions with side effects in
  declarative regions
- add subtypes with ranges so that array accesses automatically pass
- add a subprogram variant to a recursive subprogram
- rte of quicksort
